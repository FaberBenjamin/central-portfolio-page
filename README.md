# central-portfolio-page

#I'm Benjamin Kov√°cs, a sortof 'self-taught' programmer student. This is my main portfolio page, in which you can see some information about me, and the links to some of my projects. 

#The website will be updated in the future as the content and my skills are changing. 

# Have a nice day!
